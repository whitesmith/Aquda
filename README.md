# AQUDA

Wether your company uses slack, messenger, emails or still lives in the Stone Age, you are going to have those times where you really need the help of one of your co-workers. They may be in the mood for helping, but most of the times they are working of their own projects, and even though their intention might be to help you, the truth is they probably forgot about you... 

Thatâ€™s where AQUDA enters the scene! 

AQUDA is a group of devices that are connected to each other, each person has their own AQUDA, so that you can only get help if you are prepare to give it too.
