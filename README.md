Wether your company uses slack, messenger, emails or still lives in the Stone Age, you are going to have those times where you really need the help from one of your co-workers. They may be in the mood for helping, but most of the times they are working on their own projects, and even though their intention might be to help you, the truth is they probably forgot about you...

Thatâ€™s where AQUDA enters the scene! 

AQUDA is a group of devices that are connected to each othera, and they don't require an internet connection. Each person has their own AQUDA, so that you can only get help if you are prepare to give it too.
